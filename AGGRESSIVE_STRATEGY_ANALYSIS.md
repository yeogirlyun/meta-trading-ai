## Implementation Recommendations

### **Immediate Action Plan:**

#### 1. **Deploy Volatility Exploitation Strategy**
```python
# Optimal parameters for immediate deployment
strategy = VolatilityExploitationStrategy()
strategy.set_parameters({
    'volatility_threshold': 0.015,
    'momentum_period': 9,
    'reversal_threshold': 0.02,
    'max_hold_period': 35
})
```

#### 2. **Risk Management Framework**
- **Position Sizing**: Start with 1-2% of capital per trade
- **Stop Loss**: 0.5% per trade maximum
- **Daily Loss Limit**: 2% maximum daily loss

# Combine top 3 strategies with equal weights
strategies = [
    VolatilityExploitationStrategy(),  # 40% weight
    MomentumAmplificationStrategy(),   # 35% weight  
    GapExploitationStrategy()          # 25% weight
]
```

#### 2. **Dynamic Allocation**
- Switch strategies based on market regime
- Volatility exploitation during high volatility
- Momentum amplification during trending markets
- Gap exploitation during news events

#### 3. **Enhanced Risk Management**
- **Correlation Monitoring**: Avoid overexposure to similar signals
