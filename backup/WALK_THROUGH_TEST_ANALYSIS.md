## üìä **Conclusion**

The walk-through testing reveals that while the original models achieved exceptional 5%+ returns in single-period tests, they do not maintain consistent performance across multiple periods. This suggests:

1. **Original Performance Was Contextual**: Likely due to favorable market conditions
2. **Models Need Enhancement**: Current parameters are too sensitive to market changes
3. **Robustness Required**: Need more sophisticated adaptation mechanisms
4. **Technical Issues**: Must resolve code errors for reliable testing

The path forward requires fixing technical issues, re-optimizing models based on walk-through results, and implementing more robust adaptive mechanisms to achieve consistent 5%+ performance across different market conditions.
